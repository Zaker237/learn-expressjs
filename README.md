In this repos i'm building the REST API of an Project Management App With ExpressJs, Typescript and MongoDB. It also has a swagger documentation generated automatically with [swagger-ui-express](https://github.com/scottie1984/swagger-ui-express) and [swagger-jsdoc](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- NPM

## IHow to run in local

- Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- Start Application

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be launched by [Nodemon](https://nodemon.com) so it's will restart automatically on file change

Test the API with `Postman`
